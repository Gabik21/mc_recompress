Purpose
-------

Minecraft recompressor scans a directory for Minecraft Anvil Region (.mca) files and converts them in to a more compressible form. For various good reasons, .mca files aren't as small as they could be:

* They already compress each individual chunk within the file, of which there can be up to 1024. As a general rule, compressing 1024 similar streams together once is much better than compressing them individually.
* Large blocks of data are contained within each section. Data with the same interpretation (light levels, material IDs, etc) is scattered through the chunk.
* They may contain dead, unused space to pad chunks to 4096-byte boundaries.
* They include cached computed data - height maps, light levels.

All of these are necessary to simplify use in real-time within Minecraft, but add to the space these files take up. This utility compresses .mca files to its own format, .mci.gz . This format:

* Is a single gzip-compressed NBT file, like many other Minecraft formats.
* Contains all the same data as the .mca .
* Extracts a set of block data fields (Blocks, Add, Data, BlockLight, SkyLight) and groups them together so that the same type of data is together inside the compressed file.

This is a form of lossy compression, as it re-compresses the .mca file differently. It will, however, contain the same data at the moment. In future options to remove reproducible data such as lighting calculations may be provided.
